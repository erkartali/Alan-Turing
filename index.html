    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; color: bisque;">Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English[6] mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[7] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[8][9][10] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[11] Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets align-content: <br><br>

    During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

    <h2 style="color:rgb(219, 105, 219)">Turing Test</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; color: bisque;">The Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.<br><br>
    In a 1951 paper, Alan Turing proposed the Turing test called, “The Imitation Game”. The Imitation Game, as he saw it would consist of three rooms with three different people in it. One room would host a man, another a woman, and the third would be the judge. This judge would be tasked with deciding if the person speaking to him or her through a computer was the male contestant or the female.<br><br>

    Here’s the twist. Turing then proposed that this same test can be used to test for artificial intelligence. With the two contestants consisting of a human and a machine with the third judge tasked with deciding whether it is a human or a machine talking to them. The job of the judge would be to interrogate the human and machine with a series of questions in order to judge its reaction, tone, and how they reply to the questions being asked. Nowadays, the game has changed from two players to one with the interrogator’s job to determine if the contestant is a human or a machine.<br><br>

    The test can only be successfully passed if the machine if mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a 5-minute interrogation.
